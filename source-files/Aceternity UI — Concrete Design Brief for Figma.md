# Aceternity UI — Concrete Design Brief for Figma

Actionable guidelines for designers working in Figma to ensure consistency and adherence to Aceternity's minimalist, modern aesthetic.

---

## 1. Geometry & Layout

- **Grid System:**  
  - Base Grid: 12-column responsive grid  
  - Gutter Width: 24px (desktop), 16px (tablet), 12px (mobile)  
  - Margins: Adaptive, minimum 24px desktop, 16px tablet, 12px mobile  

- **Alignment & Balance:**  
  - Symmetrical alignment preferred  
  - Generous whitespace to enhance readability  
  - Consistent vertical rhythm and horizontal alignment  

---

## 2. Typography

- **Primary Typeface:**  
  - **Inter** (Google Fonts)  
  - Alternative: **Geist** or similar geometric sans-serif  

- **Font Weights & Sizes:**  
  - Headings: Bold (600–700), sizes: 32px, 24px, 20px  
  - Body Text: Regular (400), size: 16px  
  - Captions/Labels: Medium (500), size: 12–14px  

- **Line Height & Letter Spacing:**  
  - Line Height: 140–160% for body text, 120–130% for headings  
  - Letter Spacing: Default (0%) for body, slight tracking (+0.5–1%) for uppercase labels  

---

## 3. Color Palette

- **Primary Colors:**  
  - White: `#FFFFFF`  
  - Black: `#0A0A0A`  
  - Neutral Grays: `#F9FAFB`, `#E5E7EB`, `#9CA3AF`, `#374151`  

- **Secondary (Accent) Colors:**  
  - Muted Blue: `#3B82F6`  
  - Soft Green: `#10B981`  
  - Subtle Purple: `#8B5CF6`  

- **Tertiary (Alerts/Highlights):**  
  - Red (Error): `#EF4444`  
  - Amber (Warning): `#F59E0B`  

- **Contrast & Accessibility:**  
  - Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 (WCAG AA compliance)  
  - Use contrast checker plugins in Figma (e.g., Stark)

## 4. Backgrounds

- **Textures & Gradients:**  
  - Subtle linear gradients (opacity 10–20%)  
  - Glassmorphism effect: Background blur (10–20px), transparency (opacity 60–80%)  

- **Layering & Depth:**  
  - Elevation via subtle shadows:  
    - Low elevation: `0px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`  
    - Medium elevation: `0px 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`  
  - Overlapping elements to create visual hierarchy  

---

## 5. Corner Radius

- **Standard Radius Scale:**  
  - Small Components (buttons, inputs): 6px  
  - Medium Components (cards, modals): 8–12px  
  - Large Components (panels, containers): 12–16px  

- **Psychological Impact:**  
  - Rounded corners convey friendliness, ease of use, and approachability  

---

## 6. Spacing System

- **Base Unit:** 4px increments  
  - Common spacing values: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px  

- **Responsive Behavior:**  
  - Adaptive spacing: reduce spacing proportionally on smaller screens  
  - Maintain consistent vertical rhythm and horizontal alignment  

---

## 7. Interactive Elements

- **Hover & Active States:**  
  - Hover: Slight elevation increase, subtle color shift (opacity or brightness ±10%)  
  - Active: Scale down slightly (95–98%), immediate visual feedback  

- **Micro-interactions & Animations:**  
  - Duration: 150–300ms  
  - Easing: Ease-in-out (cubic-bezier: 0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)  
  - Examples: Button presses, toggles, loading spinners, transitions  

---

## 8. Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist & Modern:**  
  - Prioritize clarity, simplicity, and functionality  
  - Avoid unnecessary decorative elements or visual clutter  

- **Differentiation from Competitors:**  
  - Less prescriptive than Material Design, more subtle and refined than Tailwind UI  
  - Emphasis on visual elegance, timelessness, and reduced cognitive load

## Figma Implementation Checklist:

- [ ] Set up 12-column responsive grids  
- [ ] Define typography styles (headings, body, captions)  
- [ ] Create color styles with accessibility checks  
- [ ] Establish spacing and corner radius scales  
- [ ] Design interactive components with clear hover/active states  
- [ ] Implement subtle shadows and background blur effects  
- [ ] Document micro-interactions and animations clearly
